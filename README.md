# Magic Gamma telescope particle classification: A Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning models to classify data. The focus is on feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model training, including neural networks. The project is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `tensorflow`.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **MAGIC Gamma Telescope** dataset, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope). This dataset contains data from a ground-based telescope used to detect gamma rays.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and comparing various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Neural Networks**: Building a custom neural network using TensorFlow and Keras, and tuning its hyperparameters.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow
   ```
2. **Run the Notebook**: 
   Open the `Magic.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all cells sequentially.

## Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Initial steps to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating additional features that may help the model to perform better.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training various models and comparing their performance.
- **Neural Networks**: Building and training a neural network using TensorFlow.

## Results

The project includes performance metrics for each model, visualizations of model performance, and discussions on the advantages and disadvantages of different models.

## Author
